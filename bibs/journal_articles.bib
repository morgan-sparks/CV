	abstract = {We applied an empirical model to predict hatching and emergence timing for 25 western Alaska sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) populations in four lake-nursery systems to explore current patterns and potential responses of early life history phenology to warming water temperatures. Given the temperature regimes sockeye salmon experienced during development, we predicted hatching to occur in as few as 58 days to as many as 260 days depending on spawning timing and temperature. For a focal lake spawning population, our climate–lake temperature model predicted a water temperature increase of 0.7 to 1.4 °C from 2015 to 2099 during the incubation period, which translated to a hatching timing that was 16 to 30 days earlier. The most extreme warming scenarios shifted development to approximately 1 week earlier than historical minima and thus climatic warming may lead to only modest shifts in phenology during the early life history stage of this population. The marked variation in the predicted timing of hatching and emergence among populations in close proximity on the landscape may serve to buffer this metapopulation from climate change.},

	abstract = {An important unresolved question is how populations of coldwater-dependent fishes will respond to rapidly warming water temperatures. For example, the culturally and economically important group, Pacific salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), experience site-specific thermal regimes during early development that could be disrupted by warming. To test for thermal local adaptation and heritable phenotypic plasticity in Pacific salmon embryos, we measured the developmental rate, survival, and body size at hatching in two populations of sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka) that overlap in timing of spawning but incubate in contrasting natural thermal regimes. Using a split half-sibling design, we exposed embryos of 10 families from each of two populations to variable and constant thermal regimes. These represented both experienced temperatures by each population, and predicted temperatures under plausible future conditions based on a warming scenario from the downscaled global climate model (MIROC A1B scenario). We did not find evidence of thermal local adaptation during the embryonic stage for developmental rate or survival. Within treatments, populations hatched within 1 day of each other, on average, and among treatments, did not differ in survival in response to temperature. We did detect plasticity to temperature; embryos developed 2.5 times longer (189 days) in the coolest regime compared to the warmest regime (74 days). We also detected variation in developmental rates among families within and among temperature regimes, indicating heritable plasticity. Families exhibited a strong positive relationship between thermal variability and phenotypic variability in developmental rate but body length and mass at hatching were largely insensitive to temperature. Overall, our results indicated a lack of thermal local adaptation, but a presence of plasticity in populations experiencing contrasting conditions, as well as family-specific heritable plasticity that could facilitate adaptive change.},

	abstract = {Introduced and invasive species make excellent natural experiments for investigating rapid evolution. Here, we describe the effects of genetic drift and rapid genetic adaptation in pink salmon (Oncorhynchus gorbuscha) that were accidentally introduced to the Great Lakes via a single introduction event 31 generations ago. Using whole-genome resequencing for 134 fish spanning five sample groups across the native and introduced range, we estimate that the source population's effective population size was 146,886 at the time of introduction, whereas the founding population's effective population size was just 72—a 2040-fold decrease. As expected with a severe founder event, we show reductions in genome-wide measures of genetic diversity, specifically a 37.7\% reduction in the number of SNPs and an 8.2\% reduction in observed heterozygosity. Despite this decline in genetic diversity, we provide evidence for putative selection at 47 loci across multiple chromosomes in the introduced populations, including missense variants in genes associated with circadian rhythm, immunological response and maturation, which match expected or known phenotypic changes in the Great Lakes. For one of these genes, we use a species-specific agent-based model to rule out genetic drift and conclude our results support a strong response to selection occurring in a period gene (per2) that plays a predominant role in determining an organism's daily clock, matching large day length differences experienced by introduced salmon during important phenological periods. Together, these results inform how populations might evolve rapidly to new environments, even with a small pool of standing genetic variation.},

	abstract = {The resistance of pest species to chemical controls has vast ecological, economic, and societal costs. In most cases, resistance is only detected after spreading throughout an entire population. Detecting resistance in its incipient stages, by comparison, provides time to implement preventative strategies. Incipient resistance can be detected by coupling standard toxicology assays with large-scale gene expression experiments. We apply this approach to a system where an invasive parasite, sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus), has been treated with the highly effective pesticide 3-trifluoromethyl-4-nitrophenol (TFM) for 60 years. Toxicological experiments revealed that lamprey from treated populations did not have higher survival to TFM exposure than lamprey from untreated populations, demonstrating that full-fledged resistance has not yet evolved. In contrast, we find hundreds of genes differentially expressed in response to TFM in the population with the longest history of exposure, many of which relate to TFM’s primary mode of action, the uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation, and subsequent depletion of ATP. Three genes critical to oxidative phosphorylation, ATP5PB, PLCB1, and NDUFA9, were nearly fixed for alternative alleles in comparisons of SNPs between treated and untreated populations (FST {\textgreater} 5 SD from the mean). ATP5PB encodes subunit b of ATP synthase and an additional subunit, ATP5F1B, was canalized for high expression in treated populations, but remained plastic in response to TFM treatment in individuals from the untreated population. These combined genomic and transcriptomic results demonstrate that an adaptive, genetic response to TFM is likely driving incipient resistance in a damaging pest species.},

	abstract = {Environmentally covarying local adaptation is a form of cryptic local adaptation in which the covariance of the genetic and environmental effects on a phenotype obscures the divergence between locally adapted genotypes. Here, we systematically document the magnitude and drivers of the genetic effect (VG) for two forms of environmentally covarying local adaptation: counter- and cogradient variation. Using a hierarchical Bayesian meta-analysis, we calculated the overall effect size of VG as 1.05 and 2.13 for populations exhibiting countergradient or cogradient variation, respectively. These results indicate that the genetic contribution to phenotypic variation represents a 1.05 to 2.13 s.d. change in trait value between the most disparate populations depending on if populations are expressing counter- or cogradient variation. We also found that while there was substantial variance among abiotic and biotic covariates, the covariates with the largest mean effects were temperature (2.41) and gamete size (2.81). Our results demonstrate the pervasiveness and large genetic effects underlying environmentally covarying local adaptation in wild populations and highlight the importance of accounting for these effects in future studies.},

	abstract = {Habitat restoration for inland trout (family Salmonidae) is common across western North America, but planners rarely consider disease risk when prioritizing restoration sites. Whirling disease is a parasitic infection caused by the invasive myxosporean parasite Myxobolus cerebralis and has been implicated in declines of wild trout populations across western North America. For planners to consider disease, disease risk needs to be predictable across the landscape and influence restoration outcomes. We collated the history of whirling disease infection severity scores on the MacConnell–Baldwin scale from sentinel cage studies for hatchery Rainbow Trout Oncorhynchus mykiss in the Blackfoot River basin from 1998 to 2009. At these same sites, we performed reach-scale geomorphic assessments, derived landscape variables from GIS data layers, and assembled fish composition data. We examined relationships between the severity of infection and several landscape-scale and reach-scale variables for 13 basin-fed streams in the Blackfoot River basin of west-central Montana using classification and regression tree analyses. In our data set, valley slope and forest cover were the best predictors of fine sediment. Both spring creeks and gently sloping alluvial basin-fed tributaries to the Blackfoot River basin with higher proportions of fine sediment (particle size {\textless} 0.85 mm) were associated with a high severity (≥ grade 3) of infection. Additionally, we explored differences in trout species composition (i.e., susceptible versus resistant species) before and after the whirling disease enzootic using seven basin-fed streams and two spring creeks. We did not detect trout community shifts from susceptible to disease-resistant salmonids in basin-fed disease-positive streams. However, spring creeks showed a negative trend in disease-susceptible salmonids after the whirling disease enzootic. Disease risk appears to be predictable across the landscape and may limit possible restoration outcomes by influencing species composition in spring creeks.

	abstract = {Understanding the timing of key life history events is essential for effective fish conservation and management. Traditionally, predicting hatch and emergence timing in wild fish populations was challenging due to the reliance on average incubation temperature as a primary model parameter, which is often difficult to obtain in natural settings. Recent advancements have refined these models, enabling their application in wild environments using spawning dates and daily water temperature records. However, their broader use remains constrained by a lack of parameterizations for many species, with most applications focused on salmonids. Here, we introduce hatchR, a software ecosystem designed to predict hatch and emergence timing for a wide range of wild fishes, requiring only spawning date and water temperature data. hatchR offers users access to established phenological models and the flexibility to incorporate custom parameterizations using external data sets. The software is available in two formats: an open-source R package for advanced customization and an HTML-based graphical user interface for those unfamiliar with scripting. To illustrate its utility, we present two case studies demonstrating its application in research and management. By expanding access to predictive modeling tools, hatchR has the potential to advance studies of fish early life history and support conservation and management efforts across diverse species.},

	abstract = {Aquatic ecosystems are highly dynamic environments vulnerable to natural and anthropogenic disturbances. High-economic-value fisheries are one of many ecosystem services affected by these disturbances, and it is critical to accurately characterize the genetic diversity and effective population sizes of valuable fish stocks through time. We used genome-wide data to reconstruct the demographic histories of economically important yellow perch (Perca flavescens) populations. In two isolated and genetically divergent populations, we provide independent evidence for simultaneous increases in effective population sizes over both historic and contemporary time scales including negative genome-wide estimates of Tajima’s D, 3.1 times more single nucleotide polymorphisms than adjacent populations, and contemporary effective population sizes that have increased 10- and 47-fold from their minimum, respectively. The excess of segregating sites and negative Tajima’s D values probably arose from mutations accompanying historic population expansions with insufficient time for purifying selection, whereas linkage disequilibrium-based estimates of Ne also suggest contemporary increases that may have been driven by reduced fishing pressure or environmental remediation. We also identified parallel, genetic adaptation to reduced visual clarity in the same two habitats. These results suggest that the synchrony of key ecological and evolutionary processes can drive parallel demographic and evolutionary trajectories across independent populations.},

* **Research Interests**: Fisheries ecology and conservation; freshwater ecosystem responses to climate change and land use change; aquatic habitat connectivity; stable isotope ecology; ecological statistics and programming. 
* Since 2014 I have authored `r n_pubs` papers in peer-reviewed journals on fisheries and conservation (pages \pageref{papersstart}--\pageref{papersend}).
* On Google Scholar my h-index is `r bmm_cite$All[2]` with `r prettyNum(bmm_cite$All[1], big.mark=",")` total citations (as of `r format(Sys.time(), "%e %B %Y")`).
* I have authored `r NROW(bmm_pkgs)` R package as a result of my research with a total of `r round(sum(bmm_pkgs$downloads, na.rm=TRUE))` downloads (page \pageref{packagestart}).
* I have contributed `r n_talks` papers and posters at AFS, SFS, ASLO, AGU, IAGLR, and regional chapter meetings (pages \pageref{presstart}--\pageref{presend}).

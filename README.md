# CV for Bryan M. Maitland

This repo contains my CV and the code used to build it. Full CV available [here](BryanMaitlandCV.pdf).

I built this using the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae) infrastructure and the `vitae::hyndman` theme, and have slowly incorporated additional improvements and enhancements from others using the [vitae](https://github.com/mitchelloharawild/vitae?tab=readme-ov-file) package.
